# Important
  . Make sure before you start working create your own branch and work on it
  . when you finish push it and do a pull request 
  . Don't merge directly to the main branch

# Follow these steps:
  . git clone https://github.com/BenyettouImed/ESMS-TEAM3-SCRIPT-GAME.git  
  . git branch [your_name/your_task]    // to create your branch  
  . git ckeckout [your_name/your_task]  // to move to your branch  
  ## when you finish with your changes:
    . git add .
    . git commit -m 'message that briefly describes your work"
    . git push origin [your_name/your_task]
  . finally create a pull/request  
  . but don't push directly to the main branch
